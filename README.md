# JChess Project
### Cojocaru Daniela

## Overview
This project implements a chess game simulation in Java, featuring core components such as players, a board, pieces, and game logic. It includes classes to represent the chessboard, game state, and chess pieces, adhering to object-oriented principles.

---

## Objectives

1. **Learn and Apply Object-Oriented Principles**  
   The project aims to enhance understanding and practical application of core OOP concepts like inheritance, 
   polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

2. **Simulate a Chess Game**  
   Provide a functional representation of chess, allowing users to play a game with all basic rules implemented
   against a chess engine (Stockfish).

3. **Build a Foundation for Advanced Features**  
   Create a flexible design that can be extended with features like advanced rules (castling, en passant, promotion), 
   AI opponents (using Stockfish), and an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) with Swing.

4. **Foster Problem-Solving and Algorithm Design Skills**  
   Develop logic to validate moves, detect game states (check, checkmate, stalemate, 50-Moves Rule), and manage 
   player interaction.

5. **Encourage Code Modularity and Reusability**  
   Design components that are modular, testable, and reusable for potential expansion or integration into larger systems.
